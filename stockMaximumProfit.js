// The question is as follows:

// You will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal is to return the maximum profit
// that could have been made by buying a stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on.
// For example if the input is: [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] then your program should return 16
// because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16 was made and this is the largest profit that could be made.
// If no profit could have been made, return -1.

// const stocks = [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11];
// function maximumProfit (arr) {
// 	let sellingPrice = arr[1];
// 	let buyingPrice = arr[0];
// 	let profit = buyingPrice - sellingPrice;
// 	for(let i = 2; i < stocks.length; i++) {

// 	}
// }
